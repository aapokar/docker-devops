To run the container:
docker run --rm -it --name vepsite ubuntu:16.04 sh -c 'apt-get update; apt-get install curl; echo "Input website:"; read website; echo "Searching.."; sleep 1; curl http://$website;'

The ubuntu container was missing curl, so first 
apt-get update 
and
apt-get install curl 
was the proper fix.
